# Juno Padilla's Udacity Data Science Final Github Project
### Date created: June 28, 2025

### Project Title: Juno Padilla's Python Bike Share Analysis

### Description
The bikeshare_2.py Python file creates an interactive experience for users to obtain statistical information from bikeshare data collected in Washington, New York City, and Chicago. As bicycle-sharing systems become more popular in major cities in the United States, this Python file offers stakeholders an insight into what patterns bikeshare users have. Leveraging this information, one can determine the infrastructure and resources needed to produce a thriving bikesharing program in their community. 

### Files used
The following datafiles were provided by Udacity's Datascience with Python course: 
* washington.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* chicago.csv

They contain bikeshare data for people in three large U.S. metropolitan cities, Washington, New York City, and Chicago. All three files contain trip information including start/end locations, duration of trips, and some of the details about the user type. The New York City and Chicago files have some additional user details, such as gender and birth year.

### Credits
The Udacity Python final project files were provided by (motivate)[https://motivateco.com/], a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.

Additionally, with respect to Python resources, the following documentation was utilized:
* (Pandas)[https://pandas.pydata.org/] - A popular data library that aids Python users in creating Excel-type Python objects for data manipulation and analysis
* (Datetime)[https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html] - A native Python library that was used to standardize dates across all three CSV data files
